?What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-You create a hidden .git file on the repository and it then becomes possible to start tracking the files on the repository
-You need to do it in order to track the files in the repositiory

?How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repositiory? What value do you think it offers?

-It merely allows you to try changes on your files before you decide you want to keep them.
-It offers the chance to put together many changed files and commit them all at once into the working directory
